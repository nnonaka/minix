  (old way) Cross-building for x86

    $ bash ./releasetools/x86_hdimage.sh 

  Using build.sh directly

    $ sh build.sh -U -u -mi386 -O ../build tools
    $ sh build.sh -U -u -mi386 -O ../build distribution
    $ sh build.sh -U -u -mi386 -O ../build release
    $ sh build.sh -U -u -mi386 -O ../build live-image
    
    
    build.sh options
    
    -j njob        Run up to njob jobs in parallel; see make(1) -j.

    -m mach        Set MACHINE to mach.  Some mach values are actually
                   aliases that set MACHINE/MACHINE_ARCH pairs.
                   (ex. i386 or amd64)

    -U             Set MKUNPRIVED=yes; build without requiring root privileges,
                   install from an UNPRIVED build with proper file permissions.
    -u             Set MKUPDATE=yes; do not run "make cleandir" first.
                   Without this, everything is rebuilt, including the tools.

    You might run gnu/dist/fetch.sh manually.
